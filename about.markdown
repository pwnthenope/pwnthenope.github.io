Our projects:

- [Exploit manager](https://github.com/Omnicrist/exploit_manager) for A/D CTF, with a web-based editor for exploits and real-time management of exploit threads;
- [Traffic remote capture, indexing & analysis tool](https://github.com/Shotokhan/kanku-sho) for A/D CTF, with a web interface, low dependencies (only install tcpdump on the vulnerable machine!) and an high degree of configurability;
- [Attack/Defense gameserver](https://github.com/Shotokhan/ad_kihon) for local team training, very easy to deploy, configure and to write checkers for the services, it also has an easy, tested and documented architecture, so it's easy to extend (there is also a [full demo](https://github.com/Shotokhan/memowotoru) with a vulnerable service);
- [Utils for Suricata automation](https://github.com/Shotokhan/suricata-utils): provides a cheatsheet and some scripts for Suricata to automatize installation, management, configuration and an util to help with the rules' creation;
- [Implementation of CVE-2022-0847 as a shellcode](https://github.com/Shotokhan/cve_2022_0847_shellcode);
- [A heap overflow challenge](https://github.com/Shotokhan/heap_overflow_nx);
- [A web security challenge](https://github.com/Shotokhan/escape_room), aimed at scripting with requests;
- [WAF written in python](https://github.com/Shotokhan/py-waf), that is simple & self-contained;
- [Another exploit manager](https://github.com/gSpera/ex-manager);
